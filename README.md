### üåü **Projects**

#### **Handwritten Word Recognition AI** ‚úçÔ∏èü§ñ  
**Description:**  
An integrated deep learning pipeline combining image and text features to recognize handwritten words from images. Uses a pretrained ResNet50 for image feature extraction and a Bidirectional LSTM for textual context modeling. Includes an image segmentation module to extract individual words from handwritten prescription images.  
Built with **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and deep learning techniques.  
The model trains on the IAM Handwriting Dataset and predicts text from segmented word images with high accuracy.
